# UnitGPT

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to automatically generate unit tests for Solidity smart contracts using the **Foundry** framework. The pipeline uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate unit tests and refines the tests iteratively to ensure they compile and run successfully.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry): To run and compile Solidity contracts.
- Python 3.x for running scripts.
- Poetry for installing dependencies
